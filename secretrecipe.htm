Certainly! Here's a basic recipe for fish curry:

Ingredients:


500 grams of fish fillets (such as tilapia, cod, or salmon)

2 onions, finely chopped

2 tomatoes, chopped

3-4 cloves of garlic, minced

1-inch piece of ginger, minced

2-3 green chilies, slit

1 teaspoon of cumin seeds

1 teaspoon of mustard seeds

1 teaspoon of turmeric powder

1 teaspoon of red chili powder (adjust to taste)

1 teaspoon of coriander powder

1/2 teaspoon of cumin powder

1/2 teaspoon of garam masala

Salt to taste

2 tablespoons of cooking oil

Fresh coriander leaves for garnish

Water

Instructions:

Clean the fish fillets, remove any scales, and cut them into desired pieces. Season them with a pinch of salt and turmeric powder. Set aside.

Heat oil in a deep pan or skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Let them splutter.

Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.

Add minced garlic and ginger. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.

Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook until the tomatoes become soft and the oil starts to separate from the mixture.

Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and cumin powder. Mix well and cook for a minute or two.

Add about 1/2 cup of water to the spice mixture and simmer for a few minutes until the oil floats on top.

Carefully place the seasoned fish fillets into the curry. Gently stir to coat the fish with the curry sauce. Add more water if needed to cover the fish.

Cover the pan and simmer on low heat for about 10-15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Be careful not to overcook, as fish can become mushy.

Sprinkle garam masala and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.

Serve hot with steamed rice or bread of your choice.

Enjoy your homemade fish curry! You can adjust the spice levels and thickness of the curry according to your preference.
